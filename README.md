# ClubNav / SteamShowcase Project

A full-stack web application built in high school with Django, MySQL, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The app serves as a **club directory and media showcase**, allowing students to browse, search, and explore clubs, while administrators and club leaders can update their information throughout the school year.

## üìñ Overview

At our school, students had limited visibility into what clubs existed, what they did, and how to join. We set out to solve that by building **ClubNav**, a centralized directory for student clubs.

1. We **collected data** by interviewing teachers, administrators, and club presidents.  
2. We designed a **relational database** in MySQL to store club info, media, and contact details.  
3. We built a **Django web application** with a styled frontend where students could explore clubs and view details.  
4. We implemented **role-based editing**, allowing club leaders and admins to log in and update their club information over time.

This was one of my earliest full-stack projects, done collaboratively with friends. It taught us how to gather requirements, design databases, build features in iterations, and ship something real.
